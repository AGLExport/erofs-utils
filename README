mkfs.erofs

mkfs.erofs is a user-space tool to create erofs filesystem images.

It can create 2 main types of erofs images, compressed and uncompressed:
 - For compressed images, it is able to integrate several compression
   algorithms, lz4 is supported according to the current erofs kernel
   implementation.
 - For uncompressed images, it can decide whether the last page of
   a file should be inlined or not properly [1].

Note that mkfs.erofs can only be linked statically with lz4 library
due to the dependency of experimental lz4hc apis which were added in
lz4 1.8.0. Anyway, it's a good start to begin with building the latest
lz4 library statically first. :)

Dependencies
 lz4-1.8.0 or above

How to build with lz4 static library
	./configure --with-lz4=<lz4 install path>
eg. if lz4 lib has been installed into fold of /usr/local/lib
	./configure --with-lz4=/usr/local/lib && make
Maybe you should run this first:
	libtoolize && aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake --add-missing

Usage:
$ ./mkfs.erofs
mkfs.erofs v1.0   Nov 17 2018 19:47:21

Usage:
    [-z <compr_algri>] [-d <dbglvl>]
    [target path] [source directory]

 -d -- set debugging level <dbglvl>
 -z -- enable <compr_algri> compression (only lz4hc is supported)

 target path, source directory are both needed.

[1] According to the erofs on-disk format, the last page of files could
    be inlined aggressively with its metadata in order to reduce the I/O
    overhead and save the storage space.
